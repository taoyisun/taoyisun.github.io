I am currently a research assistant at the International Food Policy Research Institute [I'm an external link](https://www.ifpri.org/) (IFPRI), East and Central Asia office. At IFPRI, I focus on the impact assessment of regional integration, particularly in the agri-food sector, on child health. I am also studying the potential impact of the sustainable food value chain, and the country-level diagnotic analyasis for agri-food system transformation. Prior to joining IFPRI, I completed my master's degree at the University of Edinburgh (2021), and my bachelor's degree in International Economics and Trade at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies (2020).
